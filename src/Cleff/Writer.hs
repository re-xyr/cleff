-- * Effect

-- | An effect capable of accumulating outputs. This roughly corresponds to the @MonadWriter@ typeclass and @WriterT@
-- monad transformer in the @mtl@ approach.
--
-- However, note that this does not have a @pass@ operation as we are not sure what its semantics should be. In fact,
-- the @pass@ semantics in @mtl@ is also unclear and will change when handlers are put in different orders. To avoid
-- any confusion we decided it is best that we don't include it because no one seems to be relying on it anyway.

-- * Interpretations

-- | Run a monoidal 'Writer' effect.
--
-- __Caveat__: Both 'runWriter' and 'listen's under 'runWriter' will stop taking care of writer operations done on
-- forked threads as soon as the main thread finishes its computation. Any writer operation done
-- /before main thread finishes/ is still taken into account.
